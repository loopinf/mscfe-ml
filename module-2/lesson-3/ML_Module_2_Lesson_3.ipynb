    "Principal Component Analysis reduces dimensionality of a high dimensional dataset while striving to retain as much variance in the original dataset as possible. \n",

If we had more features, then the additional principal components would be orthogonal to each other as well.\n",

    "### **2.1 Computing the Principal Components and Loadings**\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculating the principal components involves the use of a correlation matrix of the data or a covariance matrix, and it only works on numerical features. These are the steps to performing dimensionality reduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Standardization: The first step in a PCA process is to standardize the dataset. This is necessary because PCA is sensitive to datasets whose features have different value ranges or have outliers. This step would therefore ensure that each feature contributes equally. Standardization is achieved by substracting from a feature its mean and dividing by its standard deviation. The standardized feature would therefore have a mean of zero and standard deviation of one (unit length of one).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Centering data around the origin: We proceed by calculating the average of each feature and find the center of the data. We shift the data so that our center is at the origin without altering the distance between the data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The first principal component (PC1) is computed by finding a linear combination of the features that maximizes the total variation in the data\n",
    "$$Y_1 = a_{11} X_1 + a_{12} X_2 + \\cdots + a_{1N} X_N$$ The implication of this is that we can increase the variance of $Y_1$ to be as large as possible. To prevent such an occurrence, the sum of squares of the weights is equal to 1, that is, \n",
    "$$a_{11}^2 + a_{12}^2 +\\cdots a_{1N}^2 = 1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "4. We repeat this process by finding the principal component (PC2) that passes through the origin and is orthogonal (i.e., uncorrelated) to PC1 and accounts for the next high variance.\n",
    "$$Y_2 = a_{21} X_1 + a_{22} X_2 + \\cdots + a_{2N} X_N$$\n",
    "5. This process continues until we have as many principal components as the original features. Once we have all the principal components, then the total variance of the principal components will equal the total variance of the original features, and with this, we are certain that no information has been lost in the transformation process. As seen in the steps above, the PCA rotates data samples in the direction of the axes, then shifts the data so that their mean equals 0 but most importantly ensuring that no information is lost in the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "In matrix form, finding PCA can be written as $$Y= XA$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The rows of the matrix $A$ are the eigenvectors and they specify how the principal components are oriented compared to the original features. The composition of the eigenvectors are the weights $a_{ij}$ and are referred to as the loadings. Loadings tell us how each feature contributes to a principal component.\n",
    "\n",
    "Loadings range from $-1$ to $1$ and large loadings (close to $1$ or $-1$) indicate the presence of a strong relationship between a particular feature and the principal component while loadings closer to zero indicate a weaker relationship. The sign of the loading shows whether a feature is positively or negatively correlated to the principal component.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a matrix $A$ and the variance-covariance matrix of our original data, $S_X$, then the variance-covariance matrix of the resulting principal components will be $$S_Y = A S_X A^T$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$S_Y$ is a diagonal matrix whose values are the eigenvalues (or the explained variance) by the corresponding principal components. The PCA performs dimensional reduction by projecting data onto the principal component space and then orders the sequence of PCs in the direction of the largest variance in our dataset. This ensures that the PCs are not correlated with each other and they form a set of orthogonal basis.\n",
    "Therefore the eigenvalues are arranged such that they decrease monotonically from the largest to the smallest. We use **scree plot** to visualize the rate at which the explained variance is decreasing as we add more principal components. \n",
    "\n",
    "An ideal scree plot would steadily bend and resemble an elbow plot, where insignificant PCs will flatten out and we get a nice cut-off allowing us to pick the number of optimal PCs easily. In case the scree plot is not so ideal, we can use the rules below to choose the PCs.\n",
    "1. Apply the Kaiser rule, that is, the PCs should have an eigenvalue of at least 1.\n",
    "2. The selected PCs should contribute at least $80\\%$ of the variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In case we get more than 3 PCs, we should consider using other dimensional reduction techniques as the PCA would not be the best way to visualize our data. In the new coordinate system, the position of the principal components are called the scores.\n",
