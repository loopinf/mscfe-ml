    "The terms machine (or deep) learning and artificial intelligence are frequently used in the same context or as synonyms. However, all these concepts refer to different things. Thus, we first need to define clearly what we are talking about when we mention all these terms. How do artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning relate to each other?\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1.1 Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Deep Learning**\n",
    "\n",
    "Artificial intelligence (AI) is an academic discipline that studies the ability of any system that perceives its environment and that takes actions that maximize its chance of achieving its goal. AI represents the effort to automate intellectual tasks normally performed by humans.\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, AI is a general field that encompasses machine learning and\n",
    "deep learning but that also includes many more approaches that donâ€™t involve any learning. For instance, early chess programs only involved hard-coded rules crafted by programmers and are different from machine learning. It turned out to be intractable to figure out explicit rules for solving complex problems, such as image classification or speech recognition. A new approach arose to solve these problems: machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine  learning (ML) is often categorized as a subfield of AI that deals with computer programs that allow computers to learn from data. In classical programming, humans input rules (a program) and data to be processed according to these rules, and the combination of both yields answers. With ML, humans input data as well as the answers expected from the data, while the program dictates the rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fundamentally, ML involves building mathematical models to help understand data. Computers start \"learning\" when we insert tunable parameters in the programs that can be adapted to observed data. Once these models have been fit to previously seen data, they can be used to predict and understand aspects of newly observed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "A more precise definition of what requirements a ML program should satisfy is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "> *A computer program is said to learn from experience with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience.*\n",
    "\n",
    "An ML system is trained rather than explicitly programmed. It is presented with many examples relevant to a task, and it finds statistical structure in these examples that eventually allows the system to come up with rules for automating the task.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, the spam filter of your email service is an ML program that learns to detect spam given examples of both spam emails (e.g., flagged by users) and regular emails. The examples that the system uses to learn are called the training set. The task is to flag spam for new emails, the experience is the training data, and the performance measure is, for example, the proportion of correctly classified emails.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although ML only started to grow in the 1990s, it has quickly become the most popular and most successful subfield of AI, a trend driven by the availability of faster hardware and larger datasets. While ML is tightly related to mathematical statistics, it exhibits comparatively little mathematical theory, and it is engineering-oriented. It is a hands-on discipline in which ideas are most often proven empirically instead of theoretically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep learning (DL) is a specific subfield of ML: A strategy for learning representations from data that puts an emphasis on learning successive layers of increasingly meaningful representations. Modern DL often involves dozens or even hundreds of successive layers of representations, which are all learned automatically from exposure to training data. Meanwhile, other approaches to ML tend to focus on learning only one or two layers of representations of the data; hence, they are sometimes called \"shallow learning.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In DL, these layered representations are (almost always) learned via models called neural networks, structured in layers stacked on top of each other. The term neural network is a reference to neurobiology but, although some of the central concepts in Deep Learning were developed in part by drawing inspiration from our understanding of the brain, DL models are not models of the brain. DL is a mathematical framework for learning representations from data.\n"

    "\n",
    "At the most fundamental level, ML can be categorized into two main types: supervised learning and unsupervised learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised learning involves modeling the relationship between measured features of the training data and some label associated with the data. Once the model is trained and determined, it can be applied to other data with unknown labels. Supervised learning is further subdivided into classification tasks and regression tasks: in classification, the labels are discrete categories, while in regression, the labels are continuous quantities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unsupervised learning involves modeling the features of a dataset without reference to any label and is often described as \"letting the dataset speak for itself.\" These models include tasks such as clustering and dimensionality reduction.\n",

    "\n",
    "In supervised learning, the data is represented by some labels associated with certain features. The model is trained, and then it can make predictions for the labels of data that have been unused in training. In this way, the model learns from input features and targets (or labels).\n",
    " \n",
    "*   Features matrix ($X$): Composed of instances (rows) that have some input features (columns).\n",

    "We are going to study the basic elements of ML outlined above in the context of a simple financial application: time series momentum. Return momentum is considered as one of the most pervasive \"anomalies\" in Asset Pricing. We define return momentum as the positive autocorrelation of returns over different horizons. If the returns of an asset displays momentum it means that we can predict with some accuracy its future returns based on past return information. This possibility challenges the basic definition of an efficient market, where historical information cannot be used to predict future returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "There exist two main versions of portfolio strategies that exploit the existence of momentum in asset returns. The first strategy, which is a \"cross-sectional\" momentum strategy, focuses on buying stocks that have performed relatively well in the past and selling stocks that have performed relatively poorly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second strategy, a \"time series\" strategy, simply buys stocks that had a positive return in the past and sells stocks that had a negative return in the past, without a comparison across stocks. Our application in this lesson will be based on this notion of momentum trading by exploiting how much we can predict the evolution of an asset's price using just information about its past performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variation in stock returns is difficult to pinpoint: Market-efficiency forces return variation to be dominated by unforecastable news that foreshadows expected returns. Regime switches, and non-stationarity in general diminish the effectiveness of return-prediction exercises. A further complication of the problem is the ambiguity regarding functional forms through which time series predictors are associated with future expected returns. All of these issues, among others, result in what is formally known as a low signal-to-noise ratio environment, which is in stark contrast to prediction problems in other fields. Thus, the application around which we are going to develop this module will illustrate the basic tools of ML and also the complicated task of developing useful predictive models of asset returns.\n",

The idea behind this algorithm is to adjust gradually the parameters of the model in order to minimize a cost function, in our case the MSE.

When the gradient is zero, we have reached a minimum.\n",

Hence, Gradient Descent is guaranteed to approach arbitrarily close to the unique minimum, as long as the learning rate is not too high. Moreover, transforming the input features to have a similar scale among them will also help to increase the speed of convergence.\n",

Linear models are prone to underfit, reality is more complex than the model, and predictions are bound to be inaccurate even on the training sample.

    "Generalizing from a few observations is usually a trap humans fall into, but machines can also make the same mistake if we are not careful. In Machine Learning, this is called overfitting: the model performs well on training data but does not generalize well when we feed new data into the trained model.\n",
    "\n",
    "A modelâ€™s generalization error can be expressed as the sum of three very different errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Bias. This part of the generalization error is due to wrong assumptions, such as assuming that the data is linear when it is actually quadratic. A high-bias model is most likely to underfit the training data.\n",
    "* Variance. This part is due to the modelâ€™s excessive sensitivity to small variations in the training data. A model with many degrees of freedom (such as a high-degree polynomial model) is likely to have high variance, and thus to overfit the training data.\n",
    "* Noise or irreducible error. This part is due to the noisiness of the data itself. The only way to reduce this part of the error is to clean up the data (e.g., fix the data sources or detect and remove outliers).\n",
    "\n",
    "Increasing a modelâ€™s complexity will typically increase its variance and reduce its bias. Conversely, reducing a modelâ€™s complexity increases its bias and reduces its variance. This is why we face a bias-variance trade-off in machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, we do not win with more powerful (i.e., less biased) models when working with limited training data, because of the higher variance of these models. For example, if we change the training data for a model, we are likely to learn a completely different set of parameters (due to its intrinsic noise). The new model is likely to yield a completely different prediction on the same test instance as compared to the predictions using the first training data set. This type of variation in the prediction of the same test instance using different training data sets is a manifestation of model variance, which also adds to the error of the model. Both predictions of the same test instance could not possibly be correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "If our training set is too small, or too noisy, complex models are probably going to detect patterns from noise. This noise will not generalize to new instances and our model will fail. Some options to reduce the overfitting problem consist of gathering more training data to reduce noise or cleaning the data to fix errors or remove outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another strategy to reduce overfitting in a complex model is to constrain or *regularize* the parameters. For instance, in the linear regression model above we can restrict certain model parameters to be relatively small, reducing the degrees of freedom to adapt the model. Regularization allows us to find a balance between fitting the data perfectly and keeping the model simple enough to ensure that it will generalize well. In the next lesson, we will describe the most relevant regularization methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "The amount of regularization to apply during learning can be controlled by a *hyperparameter*, which is a parameter of a learning algorithm, but that does not belong to the prediction model. As such, hyperparameters are fixed during training. Hyperparameter-tuning is an important part of Machine Learning systems.\n",

    "The choice of hyperparameters allows to discriminate across models to find the one that best performs out-of-sample. Still, a model that performs well with a particular choice of hyperparameters may display a poor performance once we feed the model with new instances. This arises because we chose the hyperparameters to generate the best fit for the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common solution to this problem is to split our data further into a *validation set*. Then, the choice of models will be done after fitting different models with different hyperparameters in the training set, determine the best model, and hyperparameter based on their performance in the validation set, and then run the model in the test set to have a sense of the generalization error of the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "An efficient way to regularize learning algorithms, such as Gradient Descent, is to stop training as long as the validation error reaches a minimum. This is called *early stopping*. This technique stops training when the algorithm starts to overfit the training sample. In that case, we use Mini-Batch or Stochastic Gradient Descent, which exploit random sets of data, and we can use an early stopping rule that stops training if the validation error has been above the minimum for some time. Then, we can roll back the parameters of the model to the point where the minimum error in validation was found."
