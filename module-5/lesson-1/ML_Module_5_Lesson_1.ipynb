    "\n",
    "Support vector machines is an approach to solving classification problems and has grown in popularity since its introduction in the 1990s. Like logistic regression, it is effective for linearly separable data, or data that can be separated by a linear boundary. However, there are hyperparameters that can be used to adjust the boundary to deal with non-linear data. This boundary is what we call the separating hyperplane. "

This optimal hyperplane is constructed such that there are equidistant \"buffers\" on either side shown by the dashed lines. The perpendicular distance between the dashed lines is known as the margin and the optimal hyperplane is achieved when this margin is maximized. Another way of thinking about this is the maximal margin classifier maximizes the distance to the nearest data point. You will notice that the dashed lines touch the data on either side, but it is only necessary to touch the data points on one side before the margin is achieved. These buffers shown by the dashed lines are known as support vectors.\n",

    "## **4. Types of Margins**\n",
    "\n",
    "Hard margins are when no misclassifications occur or are allowed. Soft margins are when the number of misclassifications can be specified. A hyperparameter called the slack variable, $c$, specifies the number of misclassifications allowed and the higher $c$, the greater the penalty. A soft margin approaches a hard margin when $c$ approaches zero, i.e., no misclassifications. The problem with using a hyperplane that perfectly separates classes in the training dataset is that it may not achieve the same performance for unseen or test data. This is the problem of over-fitting. When $c$ is close to zero, we are actually taking a very conservative approach by using a very small margin, i.e., the dashed lines in fig. 2 are much closer to the hyperplane (solid blue line). A higher $c$ pushes these margins further away since we are allowing the classifier to accommodate more misclassifications. In other words, a small $c$ enables low bias but higher variance. New data introduced into the training set can change the hyperplane; however, it is important to note that only points on the margin and on the wrong side of the hyperplane would affect a change. This quality emphasizes the insensitivity to outliers. The gamma hyperparameter can be adjusted such that nearby or far away points to the decision boundary have an influence. Low gamma takes far away points and vice versa. We finally get to the problem of non-linear data and the approach of SVM to overcome this via kernels.\n"

    "Projecting the feature space into an extra dimension would show the distribution of the target classes in the right plot of fig. 3. We now see that a plane can separate the target classes efficiently. This mapping into higher dimensions is done by kernels. SVM algorithms have a number of kernels to choose from, such as Polynomial Kernel and Gaussian Radial Basis Function (RBF) to name a few. For a more comprehensive list, please refer to https://data-flair.training/blogs/svm-kernel-functions/. One thing to note is that this illustrative example was merely two predictors originally; therefore, with more predictors the optimal transformation is not only difficult find but also to compute. Kernels achieve this in a more memory efficient way. The detailed mathematics behind kernels is not part of the scope of this module, but the interested reader is referred to https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2020/10/the-mathematics-behind-svm/. What we need to understand is that the solution to calculating the optimal hyperplane depends on the dot or inner product of the observations.

The parameter $\\gamma$ is synonymous with the width of the Gaussian distribution or standard deviation, $\\sigma$, i.e., $\\gamma = 1/2\\sigma^2$. Hence, this is a hyper parameter provided by the user and a too large $\\gamma$ can lead to over-fitting. The Gaussian Kernel is often used when the original data is non-linearly separable and is sometimes the default kernel in programming languages. It is best to know the default kernel used in the SVM model and experiment with different kernels."
